With the new year comes new resolutions, and creating this post on this website is one of them! I've created this website, with the help of the glorious [**blogdown**

On this website intend to write up my reflections on the courses I take, the projects I involve myself in, and the studying techniques I invoke. Each week I hope to have up at least a single new post.

This is going to be difficult for a slew of reasons, here are a few:

* I don't know how to write and, like the analysis, I'm going with the learn and post as I go approach.

Though the Journey of building and updating this site will be difficult, I believe that it will be worthwhile even if only I get use from it since it will help me reflect on and retain the knowledge that I've gathered, boost my confidence, and I'll have learned some sweet skills along the way.
