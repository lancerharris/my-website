My name is Lance Harris. I am ostensibly an "Analyst" who is trying to learn how to do analysis. I've created this website to enhance my learning experience. By writing about the material that I'm learning I hope that my retention increases. In addition, the desire to consistently post through this curiosity journey will hopefully give me the kick in the pants that I need to keep learning.
