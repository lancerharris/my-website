      <description>My name is Lance Harris. I am ostensibly an &amp;ldquo;Analyst&amp;rdquo; who is trying to learn how to do analysis. I&amp;rsquo;ve created this website to enhance my learning experience. By writing about the material that I&amp;rsquo;m learning I hope that my retention increases. In addition, the desire to consistently post through this curiosity journey will hopefully give me the kick in the pants that I need to keep learning.</description>

      <description>With the new year comes new resolutions, and creating this post on this website is one of them! I’ve created this website, with the help of the glorious blogdown package, to achieve some analysis goals. There is really only one goal and that is to LEARN TO DO ANALYSIS. But I’ve broken down that goal into smaller parts for the sake of over planning: {{&amp;lt; tweet 1079495206603538433 &amp;gt;}} On this website intend to write up my reflections on the courses I take, the projects I involve myself in, and the studying techniques I invoke.</description>
