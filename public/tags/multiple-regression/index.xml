      <description>I’ve finished DataCamp’s course Multiple and Logistic Regression and have left with a much better understanding of both topics. Of particular interest to me was learning what it means to add more than one explanatory variable to a model, what interaction terms do to a model, and how to interpret the scales of a logistic regression model. In other statistics courses I have taken I did not learn that adding another categorical explanatory variable to a model leads to what is called the “parallel slopes model”, nor did I know that adding a categorical interaction term had a geometric interpretation of two lines with differing slopes.</description>
