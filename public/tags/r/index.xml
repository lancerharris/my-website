      <description>I’ve finished the Introduction to machine learning with R course and wanted to write about the course and share my notes on the first couple of chapters.
Thoughts on the course as a whole This course was longer than your typical DataCamp course but was well worth the extra time. I think I’ve been half consciously half subconsciously afraid to start machine learning for a while, thinking that I wasn’t ready for the abstract nature of the subject.</description>
